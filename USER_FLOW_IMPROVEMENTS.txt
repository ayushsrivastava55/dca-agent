# User Flow Improvements - DCA Sitter

## Overview
Significantly improved the user experience with a guided, step-by-step wizard interface that makes DCA execution intuitive and transparent.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Visual Progress Wizard 🎯
**Before**: No clear indication of where user is in the process
**After**: 3-step visual progress indicator
- **Step 1: Configure** - Set up DCA parameters
- **Step 2: Execute** - Run DCA legs one by one
- **Step 3: Complete** - Celebration and summary

Features:
- Animated progress bars between steps
- Color-coded step indicators (blue → green → purple)
- Pulsing animation on active step
- Clear instructions for each step

### 2. Enhanced Button States & Smart Conditional Rendering 🔘

**One-Click Start Button:**

**Execute Next Leg Button:**
- Only visible after delegation created
- Shows current progress: "Execute Next Leg (3/5)"
- Pulsing green animation to draw attention
- Changes to yellow with spinner during execution
